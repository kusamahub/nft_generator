This section needs to edit script code. If you don't know how to do it, please, skip this section.


### Folders

You can edit folders name, remove folders or add new folders.
For now, if Folder appear in script, it must have images in it. If folder is empty, script will give error. 

Change Folder name after '+' if you have another folders structure.

```
HORN_FOLDER         = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Horn/'
GLASSES_FOLDER      = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Glasses/'
HAIR_FOLDER         = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Hair/'
EYES_FOLDER         = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Eyes/'
WEAR_FOLDER         = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Wear/'
MOUTH_FOLDER        = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Mouth/'
BODY_FOLDER         = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Body/'
WINGS_FOLDER        = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Wings/'
BACKGROUND_FOLDER   = COLLECTION_FOLDER + '/Background/'
```

### Layers order

In this section of script you can change position of layer. 
Layers starts from `background` (bottom) and ends on `mouth` (top)

Move up or down needed part to change it layer order.

```
# Layers order from first (bottom) to last (top). So 'background' - last layer, mouth - top layer.
new_im.alpha_composite(background)
new_im.alpha_composite(wings)
new_im.alpha_composite(body)
new_im.alpha_composite(wear)
new_im.alpha_composite(eyes)
new_im.alpha_composite(glasses)
new_im.alpha_composite(hair)
new_im.alpha_composite(horn)
new_im.alpha_composite(mouth)
```

### Output folder and image extension

You can change output folder name, output folder location and output image extension.
